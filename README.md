Welcome,  @DearSjh!

This is a simple blog system built according to mvc logic when I first came into contact with mvc thoughts.

App -- ——app project folder
Frame --- packaged class folder
Public --- imported external plugins and resource folders
Index.php --- entry file

Login against the wall
Back-end system article, classification, addition, deletion, and modification
Front page display query page
